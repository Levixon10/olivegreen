    content: `First things first, I’m a brat. No! That doesn’t mean that I am spoiled or an ill-mannered child!  
I’m an ARMY BRAT — born, raised, and transferred.

My father joined The Indian Army as an officer of Lieutenant rank at the young age of 22. He is in the  
75 Armoured Regiment and currently posted in J&K.

I remember when I told my friends about my dad and they always asked me, “Does your dad carry an AK rifle everywhere he goes?”  
Yes, the Army is about protecting the national borders, but our life — our life is much more than that.  
Welcome to the plethora of anecdotes I have — a few of them which I have listed below.

“I DON’T THINK I WILL EVER COMPLETELY UNPACK IN LIFE.”

Why would I find a Nerf gun interesting if I have seen my father firing with a real rifle?  
Why would I want to have a Mercedes if I have driven a Main Battle Tank in my regiment?

I am not called an Army brat just like that. I didn’t grow up wearing clothes with cartoon characters on them.  
In fact, for my third birthday, my father gave me a dungaree with the quote:  
“We live by choice, love by chance, and kill by profession.”  
And I still keep it safely. My childhood wasn’t taken away — it was given a new perspective.  
That’s how deep my love for the Indian Army is.

In my entire life, I have changed five cities and seven schools,  
so forging camaraderie and building bonds comes naturally to me.

Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Jaisalmer, Assam, Ahmednagar (Maharashtra) are all places I can proudly  
call HOME — apart from Delhi. Between packing and unpacking those boxes,  
I have memories that I will carry forever and cherish for a lifetime or more.  
The best thing is to tell my friends about my experience of the picturesque places I have lived in,  
which I usually find in geography chapters named “Landforms of the World.”

My dad is a person with impeccable manners and I hope to have imbibed a few of them too.  
My vocabulary is inherited, and the Army lingo flows in my bloodstream.  
Of course my dad and I played basketball, tennis etc., but the sports he loved teaching me were utmost different — like golf and horse riding.

Tearful goodbyes, postings, martyrdom, and separations were things I was taught to deal with at a very young age.  
“Brave kids don’t cry,” Mom would tell me and my brother.  
So we would hold back our tears and smilingly bid Dad adieu every time he left for duty.  
From our third floor window, we would lean out and watch him leave.  
There would be a flurry of arm waving as we would scream, “Papa see you very soon,”  
but our hearts were being ripped by the pain of yet another separation.  
Each time he left, a small part of our childhood was lost forever.  
We learnt to mask our aching hearts with a smile on our face, as we knew that crying would not make Dad stay back  
but only aggravate his pain. So we held back our tears.  
That was part of growing up too...

It’s a matter of pride and honour to have been a part of a beautiful legacy of the Army family —  
of highly disciplined, strong, brave, polished and sophisticated people.  
Army is not a profession — it is a way of life.

My stories of making new friends, playing sports, Army parties, and touring the corners of the country are endless,  
and I can narrate each one with equal pride and love.

Yes, it was also difficult being away from my father — not seeing him for months,  
praying hard every day when he was at borders,  
at times living like nomads, having to think hard when someone asked,  
“Which place do you belong to?”

But I’m proud of my Dad, and am thankful for the wonderful childhood he gave me,  
even when he wasn’t around. I wouldn’t trade this lifestyle for anything in the world.

As rightly said by the Army Chief, General Bikram:  
“Army families are the unsung heroes of today’s time.  
They are like the hidden veins of water flowing underground, making the grass on the top greener.  
Their dedication and commitment is worth to be saluted.”

    title: "The Days the Earth Stood Still",
    content: `‘War is never a slogan when your father’s shadow lingers at the edge of it.’

There are certain days in one’s life that pass so slowly, they etch themselves onto the skin — days where the clock seems suspended, and you find yourself breathing, but not entirely alive. For me, those days came in May, when my father was posted in Jammu, in the midst of escalating tensions along the Indo-Pak border.

The world around me remained unchanged. The cities thrived, the sun continued to rise, markets bustled with the comforting monotony of routine. But within the walls of my home, we lived in the hollow of uncertainty.

The news became our only companion. Not a message, not a call, not even a whisper from my father for nearly six days. Just static silence, punctuated by the constant echo of breaking news. It hit differently when the “wild border updates” were your family’s reality. When each time you unlock your phone, your chest tightens — half dreading a message that confirms your fears, half begging for any message at all.

Each message, an unopened door I was too afraid to enter.

I know how to survive in silence — the Army teaches you that early. You smile, stay calm, don’t lose it, because “Brave kids don’t cry,” remember? But even the bravest glitch sometimes. And I glitched — every time I saw a new update, a map with those little red warning signs creeping closer to his location, or influencers casually turning war into content.

The empty calls. The long nights. The absolute rage when people act like war is a game, a trending topic. My dad is not your storyline. His survival isn’t your Twitter argument.

Missiles fell like rain upon the very soil where my father stood. Each headline, each news report was a tight fist pressing against my chest. I watched the world reduce the complexity of war to numbers, to sound bites, to fleeting digital narratives. “Let’s go to war,” some cried. “India is strong,” others proclaimed with misplaced pride, their voices rising from the comfort of distance.

But war is never a slogan when your father’s shadow lingers at the edge of it.

I have often spoken of the Army life with unwavering admiration. I have written of tanks, of borderlines, of resilience painted in shades of olive green. But this time, I found myself stripped of words. Pride falters when uncertainty coils itself around you like a slow, suffocating fog.

Outside, life carried on. Conversations reduced the conflict to trivial inconvenience. Some mourned the postponement of IPL matches, others debated political ideologies from a safe distance, blind to the fragile thread by which so many families, like mine, hung.

Nobody tells you how isolating it feels when people treat geopolitical conflict like an entertainment segment. You’re watching missiles rain down on places you’ve called home, places your dad drives through, and the same video has 1 million views, a trending audio, and captions like “vibess intense rn.”

It astonished me — how casually the pain of others is consumed, how easily the noise of missiles is buried beneath the clamour of entertainment.

In those five days, I learnt what it meant to stand at the intersection of love and helplessness. I learnt that no photograph, no uniform, no title can shield you from the quiet terror of not knowing.

My father, a man I have always seen as unyielding — a soldier shaped by duty, forged by discipline — was, for those days, a phantom presence in my life. His absence settled like dust on every surface, heavy, undeniable.

When the phone finally rang, it carried a brittle kind of relief. His voice was calm, measured, soaked in the composure that years of service demand. “All okay bacha,” he said.

But even in his certainty, I heard the shadows. The silence of those six days had left a mark on us both, invisible yet profound.

I have long understood that courage within the Army is not loud — it is measured, enduring, woven into silences that stretch far beyond the battlefield. But in those six days, I learnt that the real battles are not always fought with rifles and commands. Sometimes, they are fought in stillness — in unanswered calls, in quiet tears behind closed doors, in unfinished conversations about golden retrievers that linger far longer than they should.

The world will reduce these days to footnotes in history, moments glossed over in the tide of larger narratives. But for those of us who live them, they leave an imprint — deep, inescapable, quietly etched into the soul.

And so, I carry those days with me — the waiting, the unresolved words, the small stubborn hopes of mundane arguments we take for granted. They are reminders that behind every headline, behind every uniform, there exists a family — breathing, breaking, holding its breath.

    title: "The Silence of Celebration",
    content: `The sound of applause has always unsettled me. Maybe it’s because, beneath the surface of every cheer, there’s a quiet I’ve grown used to carrying.

I’ve been stepping onto stages since the earliest years of school — Scholar Badge ceremonies, prize distributions, those neat, orchestrated moments of achievement schools are so fond of. But for me, those moments have never been whole. While my friends waved at their parents seated in the front row, my eyes always searched for someone who wasn’t there.

My mother would sit with her phone angled just right — the screen lit up, the camera turned towards the stage, my father's distant face pixelated by the weak signal. He’d be there — or at least, the idea of him would be — watching from another state, another base.

The applause would rise. Names would echo. The principal’s handshake, the crisp certificates, photographs timed just right. And yet, beneath it all, there was always a stillness. The kind of stillness you learn to live with when celebration is filtered through buffering screens, shifting postings, and geography that never seems to cooperate.

Over time, I stopped expecting the moment to feel complete. The cheers, the medals, the neat rows of chairs — they were part of the ritual, but they weren’t the whole story. I learnt to recognise pride not in noise, but in the quiet — in the unstable video calls, in the static of a weak signal.

The celebrations kept coming — academic results, competitions won, milestones reached — but the absence stayed. It became familiar. Expected.

I’ve realised — celebration isn’t universal. For some, it’s crowded parties and loud music. For others, it’s a quiet car ride home, an unread message pending, a family dinner where one chair remains empty.

In our house, celebrations often happened with just three of us at the table. Sometimes, with two. And yet, we learnt to mark the moment — with pride, with restraint, with the understanding that the people you miss the most are often the ones who make your wins matter in the first place.

The applause fades quickly. Photos get archived. But the silence — the weight of it, the discipline of carrying joy alongside longing — that stays.

And I’ve come to believe that the most honest celebrations often happen that way — quietly, stubbornly, carrying the weight of absence, and still choosing to stand, to smile, to believe.

Because silence never means it matters less. Sometimes, it means it matters more.

So I’ve stopped measuring success by the sound it makes. Some of my proudest moments have unfolded in silence — with a frozen screen, with a missing voice, with a quiet heart holding more than words can explain.

And maybe that’s the version of celebration I’ve come to respect the most. Quiet. Fragmented. Imperfect. But ours.

    title: "Where the Hills meet Home",
    content: `It’s January 3rd — a time that usually signals the end of our annual winter vacations. For me, though, this date has always been synonymous with a visit to Papa’s posting, which for the last two years has been Reasi.

Though not well-known globally, Reasi has recently become a hotspot for terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. We were en route to the small railway station perched atop a massive hill, with Papa driving us there. The journey itself was dizzying, a winding drive that was nauseating enough for me to plug in my headphones and listen to Gracie while occasionally overhearing the family’s conversations in the car.

As always, we were neither too early nor late. Papa’s impeccable sense of timing ensured that we arrived exactly on schedule.

During the entire car ride, my thoughts kept drifting to how much Papa would miss us — my shouts and shrieks that had filled his house for the past 10 days, Mumma’s endless chatter, and Harsh’s overly serious “grown-up” conversations with him. For those ten days, we had transformed his meticulously tidy bachelor pad into a warm, chaotic home. I knew, deep down, that he’d feel the absence acutely.

Soon, we reached the railway station. Amid the bustling commotion of boarding the train and bickering with Harsh over the window seat (it was a non-sleeper train), I momentarily forgot about the inevitable moment I’d been dreading ever since our arrival in Reasi — saying goodbye to Papa.

As I settled into my seat, I instinctively glanced out the window to bid him farewell. But instead of his face, I saw his back turned towards me. In that instant, I understood what was happening.

It was that one emotion — the only thing capable of softening the resolute, stoic exterior of my father. In that fleeting moment, he wasn’t the unshakable man I’d always known; he was just another father, quietly missing the everyday chaos we brought into his life.

And that sight — it unraveled me entirely.

I glanced out of the large window to my right, where my eyes were drawn to the majestic Pir Panjal hills encircling the little tunnel my train was approaching. As I soaked in this breathtaking view, my attention shifted to Harsh’s phone screen as he casually scrolled through Instagram. True to my ever-curious and nosy nature, I couldn’t resist peeking at the posts on his feed without him noticing.

One post caught my eye — it featured a collage of Jennifer Lawrence’s famously expressive faces in the background. The caption read: "Me, enjoying this winter break as if I’ve already graduated college or something." I silently agreed with how relatable it felt, though I doubted Harsh shared the sentiment, given that he was still grappling with logging into his Term 1 CGPA portal.

Our train was from Jammu to Delhi so mostly all of the other passengers in the train were triumphant pilgrims who had just finished their climb to the mighty Vaishno Devi temple in Jammu. So clearly, the three seats of ours were the saddest.

As the train chugged along, my thoughts kept circling back to the scene I had witnessed just moments ago. I had always admired his unshakeable strength, his dedication to his duty, and his ability to remain composed through everything. But in that brief moment of vulnerability, I saw him as more than just a soldier or a father serving his country. He was someone who, just like me, cherished the little moments we spent together — the chaos, the noise, the constant presence of family.

Harsh, oblivious to my contemplations, continued scrolling through his phone, the train’s motion rocking him into a quiet rhythm. As I sat there, the train speeding toward Delhi, a strange sense of clarity washed over me. For the first time, I didn’t see my passion for the Army through the lens of pride or heroism alone. I saw it as a deeply personal sacrifice, not just for the soldiers, but for their families as well.

The pilgrims, with their stories of devotion, seemed so far removed from our lives, yet there was something familiar in their journey. Everyone was carrying something — whether it was a sense of fulfillment or a weight of longing — and for me, that weight had been Papa’s silent goodbyes. I couldn’t help but smile at the thought.

Maybe it wasn’t just about the Army, or the movies, or the long debates. Maybe it was about something deeper — about recognizing the sacrifices made not just on the frontlines, but in the quieter moments too.

As the train glided through the hills, I silently promised myself that I would carry that understanding with me, no matter how far I went. Perhaps, for now, it wasn’t about changing everyone’s perspective about the Army. It was about acknowledging the quieter, more intimate ways in which our love and respect for it were shaped — by the people who loved and supported it, even from afar.

As I gazed out of the window once more, the Pir Panjal hills looked even more majestic than before. In that moment, everything felt right. And I knew that no matter where life took us, those moments, those silences, would always be a part of who we were.

    title: "Fiercely Temporary — The Beauty of Borrowed Places",
    content: `There’s an art to leaving — most people don’t realise that. An art to folding your life neatly into cardboard boxes, peeling your name off the door, and walking away before the walls forget you were ever there.

I’ve spent most of my life in borrowed places. Army quarters, temporary apartments, homes with identical blueprints but ceilings that creak differently in every city. The tiles change. The cupboard doors stick in new ways. But the process repeats — unpack, settle, adjust, detach.

People often mistake that for instability. As if permanence is the only currency for building a life. But there’s a quiet beauty in the fiercely temporary — in knowing from the start that nothing here belongs to you, so you love it all the more carefully.

I’ve learnt to memorise window views — the cracked glass pane in Reasi that let in the winter fog; the dusty balcony railings in Jaisalmer that caught desert sand in the folds of my school uniform. I remember the clatter of the metal gate in Ahmednagar, the faint taste of rust in the water at our home in Jammu.

In Assam, it rained like the clouds had forgotten how to stop. Days on end of water pressing against glass, the roads vanishing beneath swollen rivers of earth. But the rain wasn’t the only visitor.

There was an elephant — wild, enormous, strangely gentle — that would wander to our window, its trunk curling softly along the sill, searching for scraps, for kindness. It felt ordinary after a while — like even the wild things understood borrowed places, how to arrive quietly, stay briefly, and leave before they were missed.

In Jaisalmer, the desert air clung to us, and yet those were the most tightly-knit days of my childhood. All of us — the children of my father's coursemates — lived within walking distance of one another, walls barely separating our homes. Most afternoons, we were inseparable, trailing from house to house, playing, eating, collapsing in shared spaces as though they belonged to all of us. In a way, they did. There was no need to knock, no sense of boundaries — just an unspoken understanding that for now, we were a tribe of borrowed rooms and endless desert afternoons.

Jammu was different. I was a little older by then, a little more aware of how quickly things — people, places, moments — slipped away. On days when the biting wind calmed, when the sun warmed the edges of the balcony just enough, I’d take my books outside and sit there, stubbornly trying to study. The wind would tug at the pages, but I’d stay, determined to steal a glimpse of the mountains before the clouds claimed them again.

From that narrow patch of balcony, I could see the distant outline of the Vaishno Devi temple nestled in the hills, steady and unmoving — the only thing in my world that seemed to stay where it was.

In each place, friendships arrived fast, because there’s never the luxury of ‘someday’. We learnt names, shared stories, borrowed each other’s homes — knowing full well that orders change, bags pack themselves, and soon you’ll be the new face somewhere else.

Sometimes, I scroll past old photographs — sunlit army compounds, classrooms that all blur into the same shade of cement, mess parties under string lights — and for a second, I can’t place them. But then, I’ll remember. The soft slopes of the Pir Panjal hills behind the frame. The cracked playground tiles at the cantonment in Jammu. The constant shuffle of families — arriving, unpacking, gone.

The beauty of borrowed places is that they demand presence. You notice things more. You listen harder. You carry the details — not because they’re permanent, but precisely because they aren’t.

I’ve walked through too many echoing, emptied rooms to believe that roots need soil. Sometimes, roots grow in stories, in the way your body learns to settle into unfamiliar beds, in accents that soften and harden with each city, in friendships measured by intensity, not by time.

Yes, my life has been temporary. Fiercely so. But in borrowed places, I’ve found permanence of a different kind — in elephants at the window, in monsoons that swallow entire roads, in sunsets that never repeat, in street corners I may never see again, in the quiet skill of belonging everywhere, and nowhere, all at once.

And maybe that’s the only kind of permanence I’ve ever needed.

    title: "The Map in My Mind Has No Borders",
    content: `Building a Website from 5 Different Cities — How transience became my Superpower and Why I Always Choose the harder math problem

I’ve never been able to answer the question, “Where are you from?” Not properly. Not the way people expect — with a city, a postcode, or a place that feels unmoving. My answer stumbles somewhere between geography and memory, suspended in transit like the rest of my life.

Maybe that’s what happens when your earliest memories are stitched together by railway platforms, highways that curve endlessly through forgotten towns, and the shuffle of Army trucks disappearing down unfamiliar roads.

Growing up as an Army kid, I learnt early that maps lie — or at least, they simplify things too much. They draw neat lines between states and borders, pretending that belonging fits neatly inside coordinates. But the map in my mind has no such coordinates.

Most people read about places like mine in geography textbooks — landforms of the world, neat diagrams, multiple-choice questions that ask you to circle deserts, mountains, glaciers, valleys. For me, those weren’t maps on paper. They were my backyard.

They say Army life teaches you discipline, resilience, how to pack your life into cardboard boxes and start over. And yes, that’s true. But it also gives you something less spoken of — the kind of reckless courage that creeps into your bloodstream when you’ve seen landscapes most people only memorise for exams.

I’ve stood at the edge of cliffs, climbed hills, and taken trekking routes that most people would’ve avoided — because comfort’s never really appealed to me. I’ve ridden horses through uneven, rocky paths, been in lakes so cold my fingers went numb. I’ve wandered through markets where the languages all mixed together, and stood quietly in forests that felt so dense, it was like the trees were breathing too.

My friends call me reckless. My family calls me my father’s daughter. I call it instinct. The Army raises you to greet risk with open palms — and nature, I’ve found, is the greatest risk-taker of all.

In my version of the world, Jaisalmer's dunes melt into the wet, endless forests of Assam. Ahmednagar’s cracked playground tiles lead to Jammu’s sharp mountain air. Reasi’s narrow lanes curve straight into Delhi’s chaos, and somewhere along the margins, there’s always another unfamiliar city waiting, another set of orders arriving, another goodbye rehearsed.

And then there’s Leh. I remember Leh not just for its postcard mountains or the cobalt blue of Pangong Lake, but for the silence. A kind of silence that doesn’t press on you, but opens space inside you. The kind that makes you hear your own breath, your own heartbeat, as you stand surrounded by endless sky and jagged earth.

I would sit on the edge of our balcony in the early mornings, a sweater tugged over my pyjamas, clutching a steel cup of chai while my fingers slowly numbed. Below me, the world would still be asleep, and for a moment, the place — this borrowed, temporary place — would feel entirely mine.

And yet, even borrowed places gift you permanence in unexpected ways. I think of Sachi — a friend whose presence feels almost stitched into the margins of my map. Our parents were friends first which led us to meeting each other. But coincidence and fate have a strange sense of humour. Across different bases, cities, and schools, Sachi’s name kept resurfacing — not in every place, but in most. Our postings overlapped like threads in a loosely woven fabric, tugging us back into each other’s orbit even when geography tried to interrupt.

Fifteen years later, borders have shifted, cities have changed, but somehow, that friendship stayed — a reminder that sometimes, in this borrowed, impermanent life, certain people become your landmarks.

I’ve walked in and out of more homes than most people visit in a lifetime — houses with identical Army-issued furniture, walls that echo for the first few days, rooms that slowly collect stories until it’s time to pack them away again.

And yet, none of that feels fragmented anymore. It feels inevitable. Like the only borders that matter are the ones we carry — between arrival and departure, between knowing and missing, between the old place and the new.

People like to believe that home is fixed — a city, a country, a set of coordinates where your story begins and ends. But I’ve learnt otherwise. My home has always arrived in pieces — in friendships forged overnight, in languages borrowed, in window views memorised just before we left.

The map in my mind loops back on itself — no state lines, no bold borders, just a quiet layering of places that may never share space on paper, but exist side by side in me. The desert winds of Jaisalmer alongside Assam's relentless monsoon. The quiet discipline of Army compounds, the wild arrival of an elephant at my window, the frozen screen of a video call connecting one fragmented home to another.

And maybe that’s the only version of belonging I’ve ever known — fluid, borderless, stitched together by memory and movement, not pins on a map.

So when someone asks where I’m from, I smile — not because I have no answer, but because I have too many. My map is layered, borrowed, fiercely temporary. But it’s mine.

And in that map, no border ever stays still.
